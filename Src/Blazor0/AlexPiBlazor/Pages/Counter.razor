  // Based on the code, it seems like the localStorage object is undefined. This can lead to a runtime error when the localStorage object is being used. Please make sure that the following namespace is included in your file:
  // @using Microsoft.JSInterop. It is also possible that the JSRuntime object is undefined. If that is the case, you can include the following line of code in your file:
  // @inject IJSRuntime JSRuntime. Please note that this comes with the assumption that you are using Blazor WebAssembly.
